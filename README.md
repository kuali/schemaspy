# SchemaSpy - Prettified

This repository contains a custom version of [SchemaSpy](http://schemaspy.sourceforge.net/) customised with a number of features and enhancements not found in the original project.

## Features and enhancements

- A modern stylesheet for screen and print based on Foundation (no more lime green - yay!)
- Responsive design, including the removal of many layout tables.
- The '-showanomalies' flag, which makes the 'anomalies' tab visible. The default is now false.
- Make comments visible by default
- The '-ga' flag, which lets you specify a Google Analytics tracking code to include in all output
- The '-showdbname' flag, which shows the database schema name in table descriptions. The default is now false.
- The donation links have been removed. There is still a link to the SchemaSpy website.
